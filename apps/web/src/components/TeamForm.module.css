/* Matching user screenshot red? Wait screenshot shows 2-3 in Red. Red usually loss. Green win. Screenshot shows colors. Let's stick to standard or match screenshot strictly? Screenshot shows Red 2-3 (Loss), Red 3-0 (Win? No, usually 3-0 is win). Wait.
FotMob logic: 
If team lost 2-3, badge is Red, text is score.
If team won 3-0, badge is Red? No.
Let's look close at screenshot.
2-3 (Red background) -> Loss
3-0 (Red background) -> Loss? Or is it form OF OPPONENT?
"Team form"
Left badge "2-3" Red. Beneath is Aston Villa logo. Match was vs Aston Villa.
If West Ham (page team) Lost, it's Red.
The screenshot shows "3-0" Red. Wait. West Ham Lost 3-0 to Man City.
"0-1" Red. Lost to Fulham.
"2-2" Gray. Draw.
"3-0" Red. Lost.
So Red = Loss. Green = Win. Gray = Draw.
The screenshot seemingly shows a terrible run of form (all red/gray).
